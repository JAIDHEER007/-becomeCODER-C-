### By keen observation, we can conclude that numbers pointed out by the markings have a diffrenece of 8
### In a sequence, where each term differs by a constant number (Arthimetic Progression), 
### If any term is modulo divided by the common difference then the result will be the starting term or a<sub>0</sub>
---
### Fingers 1 and 5 have only one AP sequence on them. So, the a<sub>0</sub> will be unique
### Whereas fingers 2, 3 and 4 have two AP sequences on them. So, each finger will have two a<sub>0</sub>'s
